#### Version 13: An Urban Operating System

For the past 12 years Version Festival has introduced innovative projects that tackle local social and urban issues. The festival highlights projects and people that engage public interest and promote the cultural use of public space.

This year Version will focus on beta testing a collectively produced open source operating system for our urban environment. We call it an Urban OS. It's not just technology based, It's a human network. We will present works and projects that serve the common good and connect us to services that everyone can use in our neighborhoods and cities. This collection of real world software can help us manage the hardware of our urban environment and create another opening for renewing our public space.

Version Festival 13 will present projects by cultural workers, community developers, social entrepreneurs, artists, designers, boutique manufacturers, food interventionists, public space hackers, service mediaticians, urban planners, cultural geographers and adventure capitalists, to share their ideas to develop a collective hack of the current urban operating system.

This June 14 through June 26 2013, we're inviting you to demonstrate your skills, share your ideas and your visions to build a better city. We will be utilizing public spaces in Bridgeport to demo a version of an Urban Operating System. Highlights include a new outdoor festival in our parks called Above the Pavement: The City Fair, and events that promote the social engagement of our communities. The Urban OS will continue throughout the year with a series of projects and platforms that will be networked to our local communities.
