Version 13: An Urban Operating System
=====================================

## Call for Participation
#### Version 13: An Urban Operating System
#### June 14 through June 22, 2013
#### versionfest.org

For the past twelve years, Version Festival has introduced innovative projects that tackle local, social, and urban issues. Every year, the festival highlights socially engaged projects and people, and promotes the cultural use of public space.

This year, Version will focus on beta testing a collectively-produced open source operating system for our urban environment. We call it Urban OS. It's not just technology based, It's a human network. We will present works and projects that serve the common good, and connect us to services that everyone can use in our neighborhoods and cities. This collection of real world software can help us manage the hardware of our urban environment, and create even more opportunities for renewing our public space.

Version Festival 13 will present projects by cultural workers, community developers, social entrepreneurs, artists, designers, boutique manufacturers, food interventionists, public space hackers, service mediaticians, urban planners, cultural geographers, and adventure capitalists, all sharing ideas towards a collective hack of the current urban operating system.

This June 14 through June 26 2013, we're inviting you to demonstrate your skills, share your ideas, and build your visions of a better city. Best, we will be utilizing public spaces in Bridgeport to demo a version of an Urban Operating System. Highlights include Above The Pavement: A City Fair, a new outdoor festival/ block party, and other events that promote social engagement in our communities. The Urban OS will continue throughout the year, with a series of projects and platforms.
